hand tracking, count fingers, simple if-else build

🖐️ Hand Detection and Finger Counting Project

This project is a real-time hand and finger detection system built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy. It can accurately detect a hand from the camera feed and count up to 10 fingers simultaneously.

The project uses conditional logic (if-else statements) to determine how many fingers are raised based on the hand landmarks detected by MediaPipe.

🔧 Technologies Used

OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing and real-time video capture

MediaPipe – For hand landmark detection

NumPy – For efficient mathematical operations and data handling

🚀 Features

Detects hands in real time from webcam input

Counts up to 10 fingers accurately

Lightweight and fast – runs smoothly on most systems

Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

💡 Future Improvements

Add gesture recognition (e.g., thumbs up, OK sign)

Support multiple hands simultaneously

Implement a more robust counting algorithm using machine learning

📷 Example Use Case

Can be used in interactive systems, sign language interfaces, or gesture-based controls.
